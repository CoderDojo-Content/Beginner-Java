1. In these Sushi Cards you're going to make a simple game using one of the most popular programming languages in the world: Java. Minecraft was originally built in Java, as was Gmail. Just like a lot of programmers today, Java was the first language I learned.
2. The game you're going to create will be something you might have played before: You'll be tossing a "coin" and guessing which way it's going to land.
3. Since you usually need to install a bunch of software to do Java programming on your computer, you're going to use an online Java development tool for these cards, to make things easier. So go to [dojo.soy/java-dev](http://dojo.soy/java-dev)
4. This tool is called **repl.it**. You'll need to create an account \(or sign in with one you already have!\), but once you've got one you can save your code and even come back to it from another computer!
5. Once you're signed in and setup, click on the **New Session** button and type `Java` into the box that appears. Select the first result.
6. The screen that opens in front of you has a section on the left to write your code and a section on the right where you can see it run. Go to next card and you can write your first program!
